# Documentation Application: Instructions

This documentation application is a manually managed system of files and folders.  It leverages the flexibility of a file system to organize information.  The AI (me) assists in formatting and placing information into appropriate files and folders, but the actual file management is done manually.

**Key Features:**

* **Dynamic Organization:**  Files and folders can be created and renamed as needed to reflect the evolving structure of your documentation.
* **AI-Assisted Formatting:** The AI helps format your notes into a consistent style and places them in the correct files.
* **Manual File Management:** You are responsible for creating, moving, and deleting files and folders.

**How to Use:**

1. Provide your notes to the AI.  Clearly indicate the intended file and folder location.
2. The AI will format your notes and provide the formatted content.
3. Manually create the necessary files and folders.
4. Copy and paste the formatted content into the appropriate file.

**Folder Structure:**

The primary folder structure will be determined by your needs.  However, a suggested starting point is:

* `instructions`: Contains this document (INSTRUCTIONS.md).
* `topic1`:  A folder for notes on a specific topic.
* `topic2`: Another folder for a different topic.
* ...and so on.

**File Naming Conventions:**

Use clear and descriptive file names (e.g., `topic1_introduction.md`, `topic2_details.txt`).  The AI will suggest appropriate names based on your input.

**Note:** This is not a self-executing program.  It relies on your manual interaction with the file system.
